# TrackCustomerSalesProject
C# GUI app to track a stores sales.


Each customer logs in with their username and password. They can make purchases of the items the store has for sale, and their account will reflect the charges. However, if their balance is too high they will be prevented from making purchases until they pay some of the balance. The user can check and pay their account balance at any time. They can also view a list of their past purchases within a date or price range that they specify. The project is written using C# windows forms, and backed by a SQL database.
